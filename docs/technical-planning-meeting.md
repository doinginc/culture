# Technical Planning Meetings

## Definition

* A technical planning meeting is an informal discussion aimed at streamlining our development processes
* They can be as short or as long as necessary
* They should be requested by developers

## When is one appropriate?

* When starting a new project
* When adding new features or functionality
* When undertaking anything that is likely to be more than 5 days work

## Expected Outcomes

* High level documentation of the business problem and technical solution
* Developers should have a clear understanding of what is expected
* A set of Sprintly tickets for product owners to prioritise
* A definition of done

## Prerequisites

* 1 or more developers with a technical challenge
* 1 or more software architects
* 0 or more database engineers (if database work will be required)
* 0 or more UXUI engineers (if frontend work will be required)
* 0 or more business owners (if the business requirements are sufficiently complex)
* 0 or more testers (if there is a large testing requirement)
* 0 or more project leads (if developers might require additional technical assistance)

## The Process

1. The developers explain the business problem they're trying to solve and open it up for discussion
2. The developers explain their technical solution and open it up for discussion
3. We exchange thoughts and ideas, fill in any blanks and compromise where necessary to reach a good solution
4. We break the work down into small chunks
5. If the chunks of work are small enough to begin work, raise some Sprintly tickets. Otherwise, arrange for future technical planning meetings to dig deeper into the problem
6. The developers should leave the meeting and produce a [markdown document](../templates/technical-planning-meeting-template.md) covering everything discussed in parts #1 to #4
7. Product owners prioritise the work as appropriate
