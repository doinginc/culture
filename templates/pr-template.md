# Pull Request Template

Use the following Markdown template when creating a pull request in GitHub.

The "Definition of Done" section is going to be slightly different for every project, but should include a Markdown check
list (e.g. `- [ ] Is there appropriate test coverage?`) for considerations that should be addressed with every PR, like test
coverage, documentation, logging, etc.

To automatically apply the template to every pull request that's opened in a GitHub repository, place the Markdown below in
a file in your repository at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Markdown Template

```
#### What's this PR do?



#### Where should the reviewer start?



#### How should this be manually tested?



#### Any background context you want to provide?



#### What are the relevant tickets?



#### Screenshots (if appropriate)



#### What gif best describes this PR or how it makes you feel?
